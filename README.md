# Spring-156
Spring-156 and Spring-157 Compression Quantum Python Software

Algorithm Spring-156 or Spring-157:
Repeat many 1 or many times Number_of_the_file=((((Number_of_the_file*add_ones_together)+Add)//3)*T_Real)//Divided_corrdiates and Times Reality. Also, Second Times=T14

cp=circuit polynomial

How to use: pip install qiskit
